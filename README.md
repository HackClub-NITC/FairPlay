## Some history:

The Playfair Cipher, created by Sir Charles Wheatstone and popularized by Lord Playfair in the 19th century, revolutionized cryptography. Unlike simpler ciphers, it encrypts letters in pairs, enhancing security against frequency analysis. 

This technique, utilizing a keyword-generated grid, was widely adopted during World Wars I and II for secure communication. 

Though surpassed by modern encryption methods, its historical importance and elegant design persist, serving as a cornerstone in cryptography education.

## Overview üìö

The Playfair Cipher, conceptualized by Charles Wheatstone and popularized by Lord Playfair, has intrigued cryptographers since 1854. 

FairPlay brings this historical cipher to life, offering encryption, decryption, visualization, and even a chatbot interface with Charles Wheatstone himself.

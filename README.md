## A Revolutionary New Way To Learn About The PlayFair Cipher

Welcome to FairPlay, 

This Vite app was built for CodeInit 2024, conducted by the CSEA of NIT Calicut

Welcome to FairPlay, your gateway to exploring the fascinating world of the Playfair Cipher! Invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854 and later popularized by Lord Playfair, this cryptographic technique is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in encrypting and decrypting secret messages.

FairPlay allows you to encrypt and decrypt based on an input string and key. It also allows the user to visualize how the cipher works. An AI powered chatbot allows the user to take to Charles Wheatstone himself allowing making it a very interactive and hands on learning experience. We also provide in depth theory and history on the cipher.


## Description
### Encrption and Decryption function
FairPlay allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Playfair Cipher. Users can input their desired plaintext and key, and the app will generate the corresponding ciphertext or decrypted text. The encryption and decryption algorithms are implemented based on the principles of the Playfair Cipher, ensuring accurate and secure communication.

### Hands on visualization
FairPlay provides a visual representation of how the Playfair Cipher operates. Users can observe the transformation of plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa, gaining insight into the substitution and transposition techniques employed by the cipher. The visualization enhances understanding and facilitates hands-on learning.

### GPT AI chatbot
FairPlay features an AI-powered chatbot powered by GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. Users can interact with Charles Wheatstone, the inventor of the Playfair Cipher, through natural language conversation. The chatbot provides educational insights, answers questions, and offers guidance on using the cipher effectively. This interactive feature adds depth to the learning experience and encourages engagement with the historical context of cryptography.
